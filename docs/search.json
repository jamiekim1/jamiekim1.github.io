    "text": "Electricity generation has experienced slow growth, approximately 7.4%, over the past 14 years. Yearly electricity generation was considered to account for and smooth out the seasonality in electricity generation. Since there isn’t a full year of data for 2023, it was taken out to ensure consistency.\nAs the US implements climate policies and transitions towards less carbon-intensive electricity generation, the use of coal as a source of power generation has experienced a rapid decline from 2009 to 2023.\nAs a result of these policies, the US has increased its reliance on Natural Gas, Solar, and Wind to generate their electricity. Although natural gas is a fossil fuel, it emits fewer carbon emissions compared to coal.\nOn the contrary, Hydroelectricity and Nuclear energy have stayed relatively stable as a source of electricity.\nThe generation of solar and wind power has experienced substantial growth between 2009 and 2023. Solar energy now accounts for nearly 5% of the total electricity generation, a remarkable increase from its previous share of just 0.03%. Additionally, wind power contributes approximately 14% to the total electricity generation, marking a significant rise from its previous 2.5% share.\nThe most influential factor affecting electricity generation is its seasonality, and there are four pivotal moments in the total generation where the trend undergoes changes:\nWe can also see the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on generation as it hit an all time low in 2020. This historic decline was a consequence of the pandemic’s ripple effects, including an economic deceleration, diminished commercial operations, constraints on travel, and disruptions in supply chains.\nSolar generation is directly affected by the amount of sunlight available. As a result, peak generation occurs between May - August (longer days, shorter nights) while lowest generation occurs between November - February (shorter days, longer nights).\nWind generation is directly affected by the wind patterns. Wind generation climbs during the fall and peaks during the end of winter/beginning of spring where winds are the most consistent. Lowest generation occurs during the summer season when winds are the least consistent.\nThere is a negative correlation of generation between solar and wind. Solar generation peaks during the summer while wind generation is at its lowest (vice versa)."
