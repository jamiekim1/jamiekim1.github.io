I have developed technical proficiencies in languages like R and Python, and I am always eager to absorb knowledge from those around me. At my core, I am a learner first and foremost. I bring a high level of self-motivation, dedication, and discipline to my endeavors, striving consistently to excel in my efforts. My tendency towards perfectionism and self-critique fuels my continuous pursuit of skill enhancement. I excel in collaborative environments, particularly in smaller teams, where I can leverage my effective communication skills."
